# Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn in the telecommunications industry, focusing on an Iranian telecom company. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we will predict Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) using regression models and subsequently use these predictions in a classification model to identify customers likely to churn.

## Objectives
- Predict Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) based on customer usage patterns and demographic features.
- Classify customers as likely to churn or not, enhancing retention strategies for high-value customers.

## Methodology
The project follows these steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values and perform feature scaling.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze relationships between features, CLV, and churn.
3. **Modeling**:
   - **Regression Models**: Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression for CLV prediction.
   - **Classification Models**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Machine (SVM) for churn prediction.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Assess model performance using metrics such as RMSE for regression and accuracy and F1-score for classification.

## Dataset
We will utilize the "Iranian Churn" dataset from UCI, containing 3150 records and 13 features, including customer demographics, usage patterns, and churn status.
